title: "Experiment Customization"
---

To increase the efficiency and speed of cloud-based systems research, we rely on code generation techniques to create experiments. Before generating artifacts such as installation scripts and configuration, a "reservation" needs to be created on one of the supported public clouds. In addition, the experiment configuration needs to be supplied to the generator. The following two steps accomplish these tasks while the final step outputs the necessary experimental artifacts for running the desired experiment on the public cloud.
