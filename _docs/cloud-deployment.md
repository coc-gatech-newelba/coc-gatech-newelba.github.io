#### Research Challenges





	
  * ROI can be improved (a lot)​

	
  * A challenging problem: latency long tail​

	
    * Very long response time (VLRT) requests​

	
    * Difficult to reproduce, almost invisible​

	
    * We found 3, but there are many more​




	
  * Cause-specific bug fixes are limited to each case​

	
    * Transient bottlenecks as a simple model for more generic solutions​
